# MIT S.6094
My attempt on MIT's online deep-learning course to understand Self-Driving cars. Here is the website of the course: http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/. This repository contains my attempt on the two projects: DeepTesla (An End-to-End Steering Model based on Convolutional Neural Networks or CNNs) and Deep Traffic (Training a Neural Network in gamified simulation of typical highway traffic). Both the projects are based on ConvNetJS (Javascript library for training Deep Learning models), check this website for more info on this: http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/
